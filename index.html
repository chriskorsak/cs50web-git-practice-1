    <h1 style="background-color: blue; color: white;">Git Workflow Practice #1</h1>
    <p>I'm concentrating this practice session on creating a git remote repository, cloning, adding, commiting changes, and pushing to github.</p>
    <p>In this session, I'm also purposely creating merge conflicts to get used to resolving these issues.</p>
